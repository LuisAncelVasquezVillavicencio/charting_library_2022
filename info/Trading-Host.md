Trading Host is an API for interaction between [Broker API](Broker-API) and the Chart Trading Subsystem. Its main purpose is to exchange information between our charts and your trading adapter. In terms of `JS`, it is an `object` with a set of functions. Here is the list of Hosts's **methods**.

## Commands

### showOrderDialog(order, focus) : Promise

1. `order` to be placed or modified
1. `focus` - [Focus constant](Trading-Objects-and-Constants#orderticketfocuscontrol).

Shows standard Order Dialog to create or modify an order and executes handler if Buy/Sell/Modify is pressed.

### showCancelOrderDialog(orderId, handler) : Promise

1. `orderId` ID of an order to be cancelled
1. `handler` is a function to process cancellation. It should return Promise

Shows a confirmation dialog and executes handler if YES/OK is pressed.

### showCancelMultipleOrdersDialog(symbol, side, qty, handler) : Promise

1. `symbol` of orders to be cancelled
1. `side` - side of orders to be cancelled
1. `qty` - amount of orders to be cancelled
1. `handler` is a function to process cancellation. It should return Promise

Shows a confirmation dialog and executes handler if YES/OK is pressed.

### showReversePositionDialog([position](Trading-Objects-and-Constants#position), handler) : Promise

1. `position` to be reversed
1. `handler` is a function to process position reverse. It should return a Promise

Shows a confirmation dialog and executes handler if YES/OK is pressed.

### showPositionBracketsDialog([position](Trading-Objects-and-Constants#position), [brackets](Trading-Objects-and-Constants#brackets), focus) : Promise

1. `position` to be modified
1. `brackets` (optional) new [brackets](Trading-Objects-and-Constants#brackets)
1. `focus` - [Focus constant](Trading-Objects-and-Constants#orderticketfocuscontrol).

Shows a default edit brackets dialog and executes handler if MODIFY is pressed.

### activateBottomWidget : Promise

Opens the bottom panel and switches the tab to Trading.

### showTradingProperties()

Shows the properties dialog, switches current tab to Trading.

### showNotification(title, text, type)

Displays a notification. Type can be `1` - success or `0` - error.

### triggerShowActiveOrders()

Triggers show active orders.

### numericFormatter(decimalPlaces)

Returns a [Formatter](Trading-Objects-and-Constants#formatter) with the specified number of decimal places.

### defaultFormatter(symbol: string, alignToMinMove?: boolean = true)

Returns a default [Formatter](Trading-Objects-and-Constants#formatter) formatter for the specified instrument. This formatter is created based on [SymbolInfo](Symbology#symbolinfo-structure).

By default, the formatter rounds a price to the minimum price movement, but sometimes you may want to disable this rounding. For example, the average price of a position should not be rounded to the minimum price movement. Letâ€™s assume that we placed one trade at `100.25` and another trade at `100.50`. The average price of the position is going to be `100.375`. If you get a formatter using `defaultFormatter(symbol)`, then this formatter will round this price to `100.38`, but if you set the second argument to `false`, then the price will be rounded to `100.50`.

### factory
