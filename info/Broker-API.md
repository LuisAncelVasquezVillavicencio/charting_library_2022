:chart: All content on this page is related to [Trading Terminal](Trading-Terminal) only.

Broker API is a key component that enables live trading. Its main purpose is to connect our charts with your trading logic. In terms of `JS`, it is an `object` which is expected to expose the specific interface. Here is a list of API's **methods** that Terminal is expected to have.

## Required Methods

### constructor(host)

The constructor of the Broker API usually takes [Trading Host](Trading-Host).

### positions : Promise<Position[]>

This method is called by the Trading Terminal to request [positions](Trading-Objects-and-Constants#position).

### orders : Promise<Order[]>

This method is called by the Trading Terminal to request [orders](Trading-Objects-and-Constants#order).

### ordersHistory : Promise<Order[]>

This method is called by the Trading Terminal to request orders history. It is expected that returned [orders](Trading-Objects-and-Constants#order) will have a final status (`rejected`, `filled`, `cancelled`). This method is optional. If you don't support orders history, please set `supportOrdersHistory` flag to `false`.

### executions(symbol) : Promise<Execution[]>

This method is called by the Trading Terminal to request [executions](Trading-Objects-and-Constants#execution).

### trades : Promise<Trade[]>

This method is called by the Trading Terminal to request [trades](Trading-Objects-and-Constants#trade) (individual positions).

### chartContextMenuActions(e)

- `e` is a context object passed by a browser

Chart can have a sub-menu `Trading` in the context menu. This method should return an array of [ActionMetaInfo](Trading-Objects-and-Constants#actionmetainfo) elements, each of them representing one context menu item.

### connectionStatus()

You don't need to return values other than `1` typically since the broker is already connected when you create the widget. You can use it if you want to display a spinner in the bottom panel while the data is being loaded.
Possible return values are:

```javascript
ConnectionStatus.Connected = 1
ConnectionStatus.Connecting = 2
ConnectionStatus.Disconnected = 3
ConnectionStatus.Error = 4
```

### isTradable(symbol): Promise\<boolean | IsTradableResult>

This function is required for the Floating Trading Panel. The ability to trade via the panel depends on the result of this function: `true` or `false`. You don't need to implement this method if all symbols can be traded.

If you want to show a custom message with the reason why the symbol cannot be traded then you can return an object `IsTradableResult`. It has the following keys: tradable (`true` or `false`), solutions(`TradableSolutions`), reason (`string`) and shortReason(`string`). Reason is displayed in the Order dialog while the shortReason is displayed in the legend.

`TradableSolutions` has one of the following keys:

- `changeAccount` - id of a sub-account suitable for trading the symbol

- `changeSymbol` - the symbol suitable for trading with current sub-account

### accountManagerInfo()

This function should return the information that will be used to build an Account manager.
See [Account manager](Account-Manager) for more information.

### placeOrder([order](Trading-Objects-and-Constants#order), confirmId): Promise\<PlaceOrderResult>
