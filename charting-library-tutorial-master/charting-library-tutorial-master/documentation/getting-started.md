# Getting Started

## About this tutorial

TradingViewâ€™s Charting Library is a powerful instrument for displaying financial data. It has different technical analysis tools including, but not limited to, about 100 indicators and over 70 drawings. Under the hood, the Charting Library can process and display thousands of data points, build custom resolutions and compare data from different time zones.

After reading through this tutorial, you will know how to connect data to the Charting Library, including how to stream real-time data.

As an example, we will connect the Charting Library to CryptoCompare which provides data from different crypto exchanges via a single API.

The tutorial is split into three main parts: 1) setting up the widget, 2) integrating historical data and 3) real-time updates using WebSocket.

## Before we begin

The Charting Library is free, but its code is in the private repository on GitHub.
Make sure that you have access to this repository: <https://github.com/tradingview/charting_library/>.

If you see 404 error page, then you need to request access to this repository at <https://tradingview.com/HTML5-stock-forex-bitcoin-charting-library/?feature=technical-analysis-charts> and click on the `Get Library` button.
