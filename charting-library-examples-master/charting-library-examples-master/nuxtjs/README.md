1. Check that you can view https://github.com/tradingview/charting_library/. If you do not have access then you can [request access to this repository here](https://www.tradingview.com/HTML5-stock-forex-bitcoin-charting-library/).
1. Install dependencies `npm install`.
1. Copy the charting library files
    1. If you are able to run bash scripts then the `copy_charting_library_files.sh` script can be used to copy the current stable version's files.
    1. If you are not able to run bash scripts then do the following:
        1. Copy the `charting_library` folder from https://github.com/tradingview/charting_library/ to `/static` folder.
        1. Copy the `datafeeds` folder from https://github.com/tradingview/charting_library/ to `/static` folder.
