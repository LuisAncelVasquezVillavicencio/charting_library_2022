# TradingView Charting Library iOS (Swift version) Integration Example

The earliest supported version of the charting library for these examples is `v20`.

## How to start

1. Check that you can view https://github.com/tradingview/charting_library/. If you do not have access then you can [request access to this repository here](https://www.tradingview.com/HTML5-stock-forex-bitcoin-charting-library/).
1. Open Example.xcodeproj in Xcode.
1. Right click on ChartingLibrary and select "Add Files to "Example"". Select "Create folder references" for the added folders. This is important because the library contains files with the same name, but in different folders, so the "Create folder references" option adds files to your application bundle with the same folder structure as in the library.
1. Copy all files from https://github.com/tradingview/charting_library/. **Note**: Unlike some of the other examples you should copy all files from the repository not just the `datafeeds` and `charting_library` directories.

## What is Charting Library

Charting Library is a standalone solution for displaying charts. This free, downloadable library is hosted on your servers and is connected to your data feed to be used in your website or app. [Learn more and download](https://www.tradingview.com/HTML5-stock-forex-bitcoin-charting-library/).
